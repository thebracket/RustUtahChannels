Herbert teaches Rust classes for [Ardan Labs](https://www.ardanlabs.com/), is the lead developer on [LibreQoS](https://libreqos.io/) and several other open source projects. Herbert also created the [Rust Rogulike Tutorial](http://bfnightly.bracketproductions.com/).

Working with Ardan involves talking to a lot of Go shops, and helping them integrate some Rust into an existing infrastructure where the speed and safety of Rust can help with critical functions---and save lots of cloud hosting costs. So we'll be comparing with Go quite a bit!
